# Guild Configuration

Use `/guild-config` to configure Botsu for your guild. You
must have the `Manage Server` permission to use this command.

## Time Zone
Because not all users will have their timezone configured, you can
set a default timezone for your guild with `/guild-config timezone`.
This is not required, but may be useful if you have a large number
of users in the same timezone. 

See [Configuration](./configuration.md) for more details on
how timezones are used.
