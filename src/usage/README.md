# Usage

This section goes over how to use Botsu as a user. This page
will provide a brief overview of the commands available to you.

## Command Groups
Here are the primary command groups available to you:
- `/log` - Log immersion time.
- `/history` - View your immersion history.
- `/chart` - View your immersion history as a chart.
- `/leaderboard` - View the immersion leaderboard for your guild.
- `/config` - Configure Botsu (user).
- `/guild-config` - Configure Botsu (guild admin).
- `/export` - Export your immersion data.
- `/import` - Import your immersion data and manage imports.
- `/goals` - Manage your immersion goals.

## Your First Log
Before you start logging, it is recommended to set your timezone with
`/config timezone`. This will ensure that your logs are recorded
with the correct time in the case that you input a time manually.

To log immersion time, use the `/log` command and select the best
subcommand for your media type. To manually enter all the required
information, you can use the `manual` subcommand. 

A summary of your log should be displayed after you log. View your
full log history with `/history`.
