# Introduction
Botsu is a Discord bot to log immersion time for language learning.
It is primarily intended for use with Japanese media. Some advantages
of Botsu include:

- Stats across mutliple servers.
- Shortcuts for quickly logging based on media type. For example, you can log
  a YouTube video with `/log video url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSMHn6Dbd2o`.
- Import and export functionality. See the [Import and Export](./usage/import-and-export.md)
  section for more details.
- Fun stats like your most logged YouTube channel and guild leaderboards.

This guide goes over how to use Botsu as a user, guild admin, and for
self-hosting.
